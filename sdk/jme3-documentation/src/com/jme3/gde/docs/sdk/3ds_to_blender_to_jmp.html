<h1>Using Blender as a Intermediator Between 3dMax and the jMonkeyEngine SDK</h1>
<div>

<p>
The jMonkeyEngine SDK supports .blend files and can convert them to jMonkeyEngine&#039;s .j3o format. This means you can use Blender to convert, for example, a 3dMax file to .j3o format.

<h2>Importing the .3ds file to Blender</h2>
<div>

<p>
I&#039;m using the blender 2.59 at this tutorial, but if you blender 2.49b, no problem ;).
After you saved your .3ds file in 3dmax, open the blender, delete the default cube,
and import your .3ds file via File—→Import—–&gt;3D Studio.

<h2>Saving the .blend file</h2>
<div>

<p>
Now save your .blend file so you can load it into the jMonkeyEngine SDK.

Click on Import Model button and then click on Open Model button to open the .blend file. Click next, select the checkbox to import a copy from .blend file, and click finish.

<h2>Edit your model in SceneComposer and &quot;VOILA&quot;</h2>
<div>

<p>
As you can see, the .blend model was automatically converted to .j3o binary format. Now, you are able to edit it in SceneComposer ;D.
