<h2>About the SceneExplorer window</h2>
<div>

<p>
The SceneExplorer gives you a structural overview of the currently edited scene and is active among all plugins
</p>

<p>
Most plugins will deliver their own UI elements to modify the scene so the SceneExplorer is more of a global tool. The simple SceneComposer however heavily relies on its functions as other plugins might too in the future.

<h2>Using the SceneExplorer</h2>
<div>

<p>
The SceneExplorer displays Nodes in a tree that represents the tree of Spatials in your scene. Spatial controls, lights and geometry meshes are also displayed in the tree.
</p>

<p>
SceneExplorer works in conjunction with SceneComposer, the default editor for J3O files in the jMonkeyEngine IDE.  If SceneExplorer doesn&#039;t appear when you select “Edit in SceneComposer”, choose Window → SceneExplorer from the menu bar to reveal the window.
